/**
 * Abstract base class for all static simulation attributes.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must provide a no-arg default contstructor (either implicitly or explicitly)
 * to enable deserialization from JSON.
 *
 * <p>Attributes are "static" parameters i.e. they are immutable while a simulation is running. This
 * is implemented by deriving from the {@link org.apache.commons.attributes.Sealable} interface.
 * Attributes can have setters, but the setters must call the {@code checkSealed()} method before
 * changing a value! In addition, if an attributes class contains other attributes classes as
 * fields, it must override {@link #seal()} to also seal these objects. All other fields must be
 * immutable (e.g. String, Double, VPoint,...).
 *
 * <p>The standard clone method makes a flat copy. This is enough if the subclass only
 * triangleContains immutable fields. If the subclass triangleContains other Attributes objects, it
 * must implement a copy constructor and override {@link #clone()} to make a deep copy.
