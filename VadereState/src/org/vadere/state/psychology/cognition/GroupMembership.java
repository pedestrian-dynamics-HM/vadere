/**
 * According to the self-categorization theory ("reicher-2010"), people define themselves as a
 * member of social categories (see{@link SelfCategory}). When people share the same {@link
 * SelfCategory}, they often act collectively if they feel as in-group member to this category.
 *
 * <p>For instance, two protesters - which define themselves as in-group members of the category
 * protesters - walk together during a demonstration.
 *
 * <p>This enum shall capture this in- and out-group membership. The membership can be interpreted
 * as a tree:
 *
 * <pre>
 *       Membership
 *         /\
 *        /  \
 *       /    \
 *     In      Out
 *           /  |  \
 *          /   |   \
 *         /    |    \
 * Friendly  Neutral Hostile
 * </pre>
 *
 * Following outcome may be observed when two people with a given membership come together:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>IN_GROUP / IN_GROUP => imitate behavior
 *   <li>IN_GROUP / OUT_GROUP_FRIENDLY => imitate behavior
 *   <li>IN_GROUP / OUT_GROUP_NEUTRAL => ignore behavior of IN_GROUP member
 *   <li>IN_GROUP / OUT_GROUP_HOSTILE => react hostile to IN_GROUP member
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note: The value "OUT_GROUP" exists for convenience if you do not like to handle the subcategories
 * FRIENDLY, NEUTRAL and HOSTILE. "OUT_GROUP" should be handled like "OUT_GROUP_NEUTRAL". I.e.,
 * IN_GROUP / OUT_GROUP => ignore behavior of IN_GROUP member.
