/**
 * According to the self-categorization theory ("reicher-2010"), people define themselves as a
 * member of social categories. People can have multiple categories, e.g., father, football fan,
 * colleague. At a specific point in time, only one category is salient.
 *
 * <p>Our agents use these categorizations to derive a specific behavior:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>TARGET_ORIENTED agents try to reach the target as quickly as possible.
 *   <li>E.g., if an agents is "COOPERATIVE" (category), the pedestrian swaps places (behavior) with
 *       other "COOPERATIVE" pedestrians (only if both feel committed to this category as in-group
 *       member, see {@Å‚ink GroupMembership}.
 *   <li>THREATENED agents maximize the distance to a threat.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Usually, the self category of an agent changes during a simulation.
