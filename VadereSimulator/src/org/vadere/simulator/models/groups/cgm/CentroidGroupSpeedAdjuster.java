/**
 * The adjustment of speeds is based on the concept presented in seitz-2014 (doi:
 * 10.1007/978-3-319-02447-9_67). Group members ahead slow down and wait for others. Group members
 * behind increase their speed to catch up. However, the seitz-2014 model did not consider that
 * group members cannot always wait, e.g. when a corridor is very busy.
 *
 * <p>In such cases, the seitz-2014 model can produce unrealistic blockades: group members cannot
 * catch up when there are people from other groups are already standing in the way. Since they
 * cannot catch up, their group members ahead slow down and start waiting. This results in even more
 * people blocking each other, which can lead to a complete congestion.
 *
 * <p>In reality, group members would not wait in such a situation. Depending on the flow situation,
 * they would move on and try to find the lost member later.
 *
 * <p>For this reason, the model of seitz-2014 was extended in the context of a bachelor thesis
 * (hertle-2022). The basic principle is that group members can temporarily get lost and act as
 * individuals. Agents ahead slow down, but they do no longer wait if they are too far apart. In
 * this case, they move on and act as individuals. A similar behavior was implemented for agents
 * behind. This behavior is optional and can be controlled by AttributesCGM attributes.
