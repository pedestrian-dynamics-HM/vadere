/**
 * Interface for a cognition model.
 *
 * <p>A cognition model decides to which {@link SelfCategory} a {@link Pedestrian} identifies to.
 * From this {@link SelfCategory} a specific behavior derives. E.g. if {@Link SelfCategory} = {@link
 * SelfCategory#COOPERATIVE}, pedestrians can swap places.
 *
 * <p>It is designed as an interface so that different models can be used for different scenarios
 * (by specifying in the JSON file).
 *
 * <p>The <code>initialize</code> method must be called before usage! This interface defines
 * callbacks for the simulation loop. It's implementations define the major part of the simulation
 * model's logic.
 *
 * <p>This approach is similar to the {@link Model} interface for locomotion models.
 *
 * <p>Watch out: The perception phase should be finished before using methods in this class because,
 * usually, first a stimulus is processed and then pedestrians decide which behavior to follow.
 * E.g., first a {@link Threat} is recognized and then a pedestrian decides to follow a {@link
 * SelfCategory#THREATENED} behavior.
