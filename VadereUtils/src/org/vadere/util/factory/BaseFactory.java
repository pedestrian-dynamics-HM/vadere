/**
 * The BaseFactory uses a HashMap to manage the different instances needed to be created. The map
 * allows creation of new instances via the FullyQualifiedName(FQN) as a String. This is the main
 * use case because of the serialization ot attributes to JSON.
 *
 * <p>Within the Map the FQN as string maps to a FactoryObject congaing at least the Class Object
 * and a Supplier for the FQN. The Suppliers are generated via annotation processing an point to
 * normal getters using the >new< statement with the default constructor.
 *
 * <p>In the FactoryObject additional information can be saved such as labels or descriptions.
 * Access to these additional information must be provided by the implementation of the {@link
 * BaseFactory} class.
 *
 * @param <T> super type of Object used for Supplier
 * @param <O> FactoryObject based on type T
